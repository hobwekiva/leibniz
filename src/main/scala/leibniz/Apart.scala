/**
  * In constructive mathematics, an apartness relation is a constructive
  * form of inequality, and is often taken to be more basic than equality.
  * It is often written as # to distinguish from the negation of equality
  * (the denial inequality) â‰ , which is weaker.
  *
  * An apartness relation is a symmetric irreflexive binary relation with
  * the additional condition that if two elements are apart, then any other
  * element is apart from at least one of them (this last property is often
  * called co-transitivity or comparison).
